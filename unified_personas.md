# Unified Personas

**Source of truth for active personas and topics.**  
**Date:** February 2026 | **System:** Phoenix V4 | **Target:** 1,008 books / 24 brands / 12 months

---

## Source of truth and scope

- **This file** is the single source of truth for **active** personas and **active** topics in the Phoenix catalog.
- **Active personas:** Only the 10 personas defined in **Part 1** below are active. All others (e.g. `nyc_executives`, `educators`, `sf_founders`, `smb_owners`, `parents_teens`, and any legacy IDs in config or atoms) are **inactive**. Pipeline, config, and catalog planning must use only the persona IDs and topic IDs listed here.
- **Active topics:** Only the 12 topics defined in **Part 2** are canonical production topics. Other topic IDs are inactive for catalog planning unless explicitly added to this doc.
- **Config alignment:** `config/catalog_planning/canonical_personas.yaml`, `topic_engine_bindings.yaml`, topic lattice, and series wrapper persona hooks should align with this document. Dev should expand or migrate from old canonical lists to the registry below.

---

## Part 0: Design foundation (from unified personas design)

Content below is the locked design layer that makes persona × topic assembly buildable. It is moved here from the unified_personas design transcript so one doc holds both **who we write for** (Part 1–2) and **how the system thinks about content** (this part).

### Canonical vs persona-specific

- **Canonical example = mechanism truth.** What *shift* we’re engineering (and what “good” feels like when it lands). Used for validation and as the reference.
- **Persona template = voiced expression.** What the shift sounds like for this listener. The canonical proves the mechanism works; the persona template earns the listener’s trust.
- **Atom roles** are story-arc roles: **RECOGNITION → MECHANISM_PROOF → TURNING_POINT → EMBODIMENT.** Content type (what the atom talks about) and arc role (what the atom does in the story) are two dimensions; the planner selects by role first, then content compatibility.

### Hierarchy (four layers)

| Level        | Owns        | Responsibility                    |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Mechanism** | Truth       | What changes in the listener      |
| **Arc**       | Direction   | How we get there across time     |
| **Atom role** | Delivery    | What this moment does             |
| **Template**  | Voice       | How it sounds to this persona    |

Stories are deliberate psychological operations: they must support, not contradict, the chapter’s mechanism. Resolution timing is enforced (no cheap catharsis in early atoms).

### Story arc and somatic arc

- **Narrative arc:** Setup → Constraint → Somatic Peak → Twist → Re-orientation.
- **Somatic arc:** Activation → Hold → Release → Integration.  
These run in parallel; the twist may land before or after somatic release.

### Scaling (personas × topics)

- **Constants (authored once):** Mechanisms, role contracts, signal dictionaries, validation stack, canonical arc/role exemplars.
- **Multiplies by topic:** Story engines, exercise mappings, chapter arc plan templates per engine.
- **Multiplies by persona:** Variable files, template sets (Topics × Engines × Personas × Roles).
- **LLM at design time only.** Intelligence produces frozen artifacts (mechanism definitions, arc exemplars, role contracts, content-to-role mappings). After that, planners select, assemblers hydrate, validators enforce. No runtime generation.

## PART 1: PERSONA REGISTRY (10 Canonical Production Personas)

### Revenue Tier Assignment

**[provisional internal SAM estimate]** — The **Revenue Est. (US Annual)** column is **not** comparable to publisher receipt totals or listener-incidence figures without a documented segmentation model. Per `artifacts/research/citations/RCG-001_revenue_estimates.md`, industry anchors (US audiobook receipts, listener incidence, adult population denominator) are cited in **## References** at the end of this document; persona dollar bands remain internal planning estimates until a syndicated SAM or published methodology is added. **Niche workforce counts** in this table (e.g. $3.4M / $2.5M) are **not** covered by Batch 1 — treat as internal placeholders unless a separate citation is added.

| Tier | Persona ID | Display Name | Revenue Est. (US Annual) | Atom Status |
|------|-----------|--------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| **1** | `millennial_women_professionals` | Millennial Women Professionals | $130–165M | **NEW — No atoms** |
| **1** | `tech_finance_burnout` | Tech & Finance Burnout Professionals | $80–120M | **PARTIAL — nyc_executives + sf_founders atoms exist** |
| **1** | `entrepreneurs` | Entrepreneurs & Solopreneurs | $60–100M | **PARTIAL — overlaps smb_owners** |
| **2** | `working_parents` | Working Parents of Young Children | $70–100M | **NEW — parents_teens metadata exists, no atoms** |
| **2** | `gen_x_sandwich` | Gen X Sandwich Generation | $165M+ | **NEW — No atoms** |
| **2** | `corporate_managers` | Corporate Middle Managers | $50–80M | **PARTIAL — overlaps nyc_executives** |
| **3** | `gen_z_professionals` | Gen Z Professionals | Included in Tier 1 overlap | **STRONG — most existing atoms** |
| **3** | `healthcare_rns` | Healthcare RNs | Niche ($3.4M workforce) | **GOOD — templates + atoms exist** |
| **3** | `gen_alpha_students` | Gen Alpha Students | Low (no purchasing power) | **PARTIAL — templates exist** |
| **3** | `first_responders` | First Responders | Niche ($2.5M workforce) | **NEW — No atoms** |

    outro: and something in you recognized this couldn't keep going.
