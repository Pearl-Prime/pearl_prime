# Pearl News Option B — Run from Qwen or Qwen-Agent repo

**Purpose:** Copy Pearl News into Ahjan108/Qwen-Agent (or Ahjan108/Qwen) and run the scheduled pipeline there, with optional LLM expansion via LM Studio on a self-hosted runner.

**Authority:** [DOCS_INDEX.md](./DOCS_INDEX.md), [PEARL_NEWS_GITHUB_SCHEDULING.md](./PEARL_NEWS_GITHUB_SCHEDULING.md).

---

## 1. Pick target repo

Use **one** of:

- **Ahjan108/Qwen-Agent** (recommended)
- **Ahjan108/Qwen**

Clone it locally if you haven’t:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ahjan108/Qwen-Agent.git
cd Qwen-Agent
# or: git clone https://github.com/Ahjan108/Qwen.git && cd Qwen
```

---

## 2. Copy Pearl News code into the target repo

**Note:** phoenix_omega no longer contains `.github/workflows/pearl_news_scheduled*.yml`. The **canonical workflows** for Pearl News are in **Qwen-Agent** (pearl_news_scheduled.yml, pearl_news_manual_expand.yml). To add or change workflows in Qwen-Agent, edit them there. For the full map of which repo has which workflows, see [GITHUB_OPERATIONS_FRAMEWORK.md](./GITHUB_OPERATIONS_FRAMEWORK.md).

If you are setting up a **new** clone of Qwen-Agent and need to bring in Pearl News code from phoenix_omega, from a directory that contains **both** `phoenix_omega` and the target repo, run from the **parent** of both (adjust paths if your names differ):

```bash
# Set paths (change Qwen-Agent to Qwen if using that repo)
PHOENIX="phoenix_omega"
TARGET="Qwen-Agent"

# pearl_news/ (entire folder)
cp -R "$PHOENIX/pearl_news" "$TARGET/"

# Scripts and tests
cp "$PHOENIX/scripts/pearl_news_post_to_wp.py" "$TARGET/scripts/"
cp "$PHOENIX/tests/test_pearl_news_quality_gates_minimal.py" "$TARGET/tests/"
cp "$PHOENIX/tests/test_pearl_news_pipeline_e2e.py" "$TARGET/tests/"
```

Workflow files are already in Qwen-Agent; do not copy workflow YAML from phoenix_omega (those files were removed). If the target repo has no `scripts/` or `tests/` yet, create them first: `mkdir -p "$TARGET/scripts" "$TARGET/tests"`.

---

## 3. Commit and push to target repo `main`

```bash
cd "$TARGET"
git add pearl_news/ scripts/pearl_news_post_to_wp.py tests/test_pearl_news_*.py
git status
git commit -m "Add Pearl News pipeline and scheduled workflow (Option B)"
git push origin main
```

---

## 4. Add GitHub secrets in the target repo

In the **target** repo (Qwen-Agent or Qwen):

1. Go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**.
2. Add **Repository secrets**:

| Secret | Example / notes |
|--------|------------------|
| `WORDPRESS_SITE_URL` | `https://pearlnewsuna.org` |
| `WORDPRESS_USERNAME` | WordPress username (e.g. `admin`) |
| `WORDPRESS_APP_PASSWORD` | Application password from WP Profile → Application Passwords |
| `QWEN_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:1234/v1` (LM Studio) or your self-hosted Qwen API URL |
| `QWEN_API_KEY` | e.g. `lm-studio` or your API key |
| `QWEN_MODEL` | e.g. `Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct` (must match the model name in LM Studio) |

If you **don’t** set `QWEN_*`, the pipeline still runs but skips LLM expansion (no `--expand` effect). WordPress posting still works when the three `WORDPRESS_*` secrets are set.

---

## 5. Self-hosted runner (for LM Studio)

1. On the Mac (or machine) where LM Studio runs: **Settings → Actions → Runners → New self-hosted runner**, follow the instructions to add the runner to the **target** repo (or org).
2. Run the runner app so it’s online when the workflow triggers: `cd /path/to/Qwen-Agent/actions-runner && ./run.sh` (see [GITHUB_OPERATIONS_FRAMEWORK.md](./GITHUB_OPERATIONS_FRAMEWORK.md) for runner start and _diag cleanup if you hit “file already exists” errors).
3. Ensure LM Studio is running and the model is loaded so `http://localhost:1234/v1` (or your `QWEN_BASE_URL`) is reachable when the job runs.

---

## 6. Trigger and verify

1. In the target repo: **Actions → “Pearl News scheduled” → Run workflow** (branch: `main`).
2. Wait for the run to finish.
3. Verify:
   - **Artifacts:** `pearl_news_drafts` is uploaded (contains `artifacts/pearl_news/drafts`).
   - **WordPress:** If secrets are set, a draft post is created (check WP Admin).
   - **Run:** Green check.

---

## 7. LM Studio reliability (self-hosted)

If the workflow runs but **LLM expansion times out**, use these practices.

**Already in this repo (copy to target):**

- **Job timeout:** `timeout-minutes: 45` so runs don’t hit overall timeout before LLM calls finish.
- **Safe-mode toggles:** `PEARL_NEWS_EXPAND` and `PEARL_NEWS_LIMIT` in the workflow `env`. **Default (scheduled):** `PEARL_NEWS_EXPAND: "false"`, `PEARL_NEWS_LIMIT: "3"` — schedule = no expand for reliable drafts.
- **Expansion config:** `pearl_news/config/llm_expansion.yaml` has `timeout: 360` (seconds per article), `max_tokens: 1200` (lower load than 2048).

**Best practice:** Schedule = no expand; manual/low-volume run = expand. Avoids broken scheduled runs.

**What you should do:**

1. **Scheduled runs** — Keep `PEARL_NEWS_EXPAND: "false"` so cron runs produce drafts without LLM calls; no timeout risk.
2. **Manual expansion** — When the machine is free, trigger a manual run and set in workflow env: `PEARL_NEWS_EXPAND: "true"`, `PEARL_NEWS_LIMIT: "1"` (or edit the workflow file temporarily).
3. **LM Studio load** — Parallel slots: 1; keep only `qwen3-14b` (or one model) loaded; don’t run other heavy jobs during the workflow.
4. **Acceptance:** Workflow green 3 runs in a row; `pearl_news_drafts` artifact each run; WP step succeeds or dry-runs cleanly.

**Optional:** To flip expand without editing YAML, use repo variables: e.g. `PEARL_NEWS_EXPAND: ${{ vars.PEARL_NEWS_EXPAND || 'false' }}` and set the variable in Settings → Variables.

## Quick reference

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Choose Ahjan108/Qwen-Agent or Ahjan108/Qwen |
| 2 | Copy `pearl_news/`, post script, two tests, self-hosted workflow (see §2) |
| 3 | Commit and push to `main` |
| 4 | Add 6 secrets (3 WordPress + 3 Qwen) in target repo |
| 5 | Install and run self-hosted runner; keep LM Studio up |
| 6 | Run workflow from Actions and check artifacts + WP draft |
| 7 | If LLM times out: see §7 (schedule = no expand; manual = expand; timeout 360, max_tokens 1200) |
