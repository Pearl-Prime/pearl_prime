## 1. What Pearl News Is (and Is Not)

Pearl News is civic journalism. It covers world events through two lenses simultaneously: the impact on young people, and the response of ethical/spiritual traditions. It is published by the United Spiritual Leaders Forum but operates with full editorial independence.

**It is:**
- Accurate, sourced, verifiable civic reporting
- Youth-specific (data, geography, named story — not "young people feel")
- SDG-aligned (woven in, not bolted on)
- Spiritually grounded without being devotional

**It is not:**
- A platform for promoting any teacher, organization, or practice
- A devotional or inspirational publication
- A UN affiliate or partner publication
- A generic "wellness" or "mindfulness" outlet

**The test for any sentence:** Would this sentence appear in a Reuters piece, a UNICEF brief, or a Christian Science Monitor feature? If yes, it belongs. If it reads like a newsletter from a spiritual retreat center, it does not.

---

## 2. The 4-Layer Blend

Every Pearl News article is built from four layers. The balance shifts by template, but all four must be present.

| Layer | What it contributes | Failure mode |
|---|---|---|
| **News** | The event: what happened, where, when, verified facts | Generic summary with no edge |
| **Youth** | Specific impact on a named age group, region, or cohort | "Young people are affected" with no data |
| **Teacher / Spiritual** | An ethical or contemplative perspective that reframes the event | Promotional quote; devotional language; obvious |
| **SDG** | A policy and systemic frame that grounds the article in global stakes | SDG number cited at the end with no integration |

The layers should **interpenetrate**, not stack. A great paragraph has news fact + youth implication + a teaching angle woven through a single idea — not four separate sections that ignore each other.

---

## 3. Voice Rules

### Precision over sentiment

Every claim must be traceable. Cut any sentence that could have been written without reading the source.

- ✗ "Young people increasingly struggle with the pressures of modern life."
- ✓ "A 2024 UNICEF survey of 20,000 adolescents across 21 countries found that 45% reported feeling anxious most days."

### Behavior over emotion labels

Show what people do, not what they feel. This applies to both youth subjects and teacher perspectives.

- ✗ "Youth feel overwhelmed by climate change."
- ✓ "In cities where heat events have become annual, school attendance drops an average of 12% during extreme heat weeks."

- ✗ "Spiritual teachers emphasize the importance of inner peace."
- ✓ "Forum teachers working in Gaza have begun hosting breath-based grounding sessions at community centers — not as therapy, but as a daily infrastructure."

### Neutral but not flat

Neutral means unbiased, not emotionless. A Pearl News article can hold real stakes, real cost, real human weight. It cannot editorialize or advocate.

- ✗ "This crisis demands urgent action." (editorial)
- ✓ "The gap between formal policy commitments and lived youth experience has widened each year since 2020." (verifiable observation)

### Short sentences carry more weight

The prose should breathe. Long compound sentences bury the information. Put one idea per sentence when the stakes are high.

- ✗ "Youth climate activists, many of whom are under 25 and from the Global South where climate impacts are most severe, are increasingly turning to contemplative practices as a source of resilience."
- ✓ "Many of the world's most active climate organizers are under 25. A growing number are from regions where climate impacts are already daily realities — not future projections. Some are turning to contemplative practice not as spiritual devotion but as operational resilience."

### No rhetorical questions

They sound preachy in text and condescending in news. Convert every question to a statement.

- ✗ "What does it mean to be young in a world defined by cascading crises?"
- ✓ "Being young in 2025 means inheriting decisions made across decades, with a narrowing window to respond."

---

## 4. The Lede

The lede is the first sentence or short paragraph. It is the single highest-leverage piece of writing in any article. Generic ledes kill engagement before the article starts.

**What makes a great Pearl News lede:**
- Specific — a named place, a number, a named person (real or composite), a concrete action
- Present-tense when possible — creates immediacy
- Shows the gap or the tension — the reader should feel the cost or the stakes
- Does NOT announce what the article is about — it puts the reader inside the story

**Lede patterns by template:**

**Hard news / spiritual response:**
Open on the sharpest fact from the event. One number, one location, one consequence.
> "Three weeks after the floods receded from Dhaka's outer districts, 40,000 students had not returned to school."

**Youth feature:**
Open on a specific young person, a specific behavior, or a data contradiction.
> "In Nairobi, 19-year-old climate organizer Amara Odhiambo schedules her most important calls for 5 a.m. — before the heat makes concentration impossible."

**Explainer:**
Open on the contradiction, the gap, or the thing most people don't know.
> "The SDG 4 global education target assumed connectivity. It did not account for what connectivity actually looks like in a household of six sharing one phone."

**Interfaith dialogue report:**
Open on what was unusual, unexpected, or significant about this gathering — not the fact that it happened.
> "For the first time, youth delegates outnumbered faith leaders at the Forum's annual convening — and ran three of the working groups."

**Commentary:**
Open on the thesis, stated precisely and without hedge.
> "The spiritual traditions present in this Forum have something specific to contribute to AI governance discussions — and they are not contributing it."

## 5. Per-Template Writing Guide

### 5.1 Hard News + Spiritual Response

**Emotional register:** Precise, urgent, grounded. This is not a feature; it is a news report with a response layer.

**News summary slot:** Lead with the most specific, verifiable fact. Time-stamp the event. Cite the source. Do not editorialize. Two to three sentences maximum before the story widens.

**Youth impact slot:** Requires at least one of: a data point (number, percentage, survey), a named region, or a named age cohort. "Youth" alone is not sufficient. "Adolescents ages 13–17 in coastal Bangladesh" is sufficient.

**Teacher perspective slot:** The teacher's contribution is a frame, a practice, or a recontextualization — not a quote validating the news event. It should add something the reader could not get from the news story alone.

**Forward look slot:** One sentence on what is being tracked, decided, or possible. Not a call to action. Not hope. A specific near-term development.

---

### 5.2 Youth Feature

**Emotional register:** Intimate, humanizing, specific. This is the template closest to long-form journalism. It can carry more narrative weight.

**Youth narrative slot:** Open on a specific person, cohort, or place. Do not open on data — use data in the second or third paragraph. The human story or behavior comes first.

**Data / research slot:** The data should confirm, deepen, or complicate the opening story — not replace it. The reader should feel the data landing against something concrete they already understood.

**Teacher reflection slot:** In the youth feature, the teacher layer often works best as a reframe — a way of naming what the young person or cohort is already doing, without reducing it to doctrine. Avoid teacher quotes that explain the situation to the young people described; let the teaching illuminate, not instruct.

**Solutions slot:** Practical and grounded. Not "seek community." Name an actual program, an actual practice used by an actual cohort, or an actual policy under consideration. Hopeful but verifiable.

---

### 5.3 Commentary

**Label requirement:** Must be labeled "Commentary" — in the headline area and in the article body. Non-negotiable per `editorial_firewall.yaml`.

**Thesis slot:** The thesis is one claim, stated precisely. It should be arguable — meaning someone could disagree. If no one could disagree, it is not a thesis.

- ✗ "Peace requires cooperation." (no one disagrees)
- ✓ "The Forum's convening model has prioritized inter-tradition dialogue at the expense of intra-tradition generational transfer — and this is becoming a strategic liability."

**Teaching interpretation slot:** The teaching layer in commentary carries explicit interpretive weight. This is the one template where a teacher's framing can be foregrounded — but it must be applied to the event, not recited as doctrine.

**Civic recommendation slot:** One specific, actionable recommendation. Not a value statement. Not "more dialogue." A named institution + a named action + a named timeframe when possible.

---

### 5.4 Explainer / Context

**Emotional register:** Authoritative, accessible, layered. The reader comes in confused; they leave with a clear model.

**What happened slot:** Brief — this is not where the explanation lives. Two sentences max. The reader does not need the news again; they need to understand it.

**Historical background slot:** The value of the explainer is in the frame the reader did not have. One key historical or structural fact that recontextualizes everything that follows.

**Ethical / spiritual dimension slot:** In the explainer, this layer works best as a question the tradition asks — a frame the news analysis typically omits. Not an answer. The best explainers open a dimension; they do not close it.

**Youth implications slot:** Be specific about which youth are implicated, in which ways, at which timescale.

---

### 5.5 Interfaith Dialogue Report

**Emotional register:** Diplomatic, precise, forward-looking. This is a record, not a celebration.

**Event summary slot:** What happened, who was there, what was decided or expressed. Avoid "historic" and "landmark" unless the claim is substantiated.

**Leaders present slot:** Name the leaders or traditions represented. Do not inflate institutional standing. Use accurate titles.

**Themes slot:** Report the themes discussed — do not editorialize their significance. "Three working groups focused on..." not "Participants engaged in profound dialogue about..."

**Youth commitments slot:** Youth presence and voice at these events is a Pearl News priority. If youth delegates were present, what did they say, decide, or commit to? If they were not present, note the absence.

---

## 6. Teacher / Spiritual Layer Integration

The teacher/spiritual layer is Pearl News's differentiating voice. It is also the layer most at risk of becoming generic, promotional, or devotional. These rules govern it.

### What the teacher layer does

It provides a frame that the secular news analysis does not. This can be:
- A contemplative practice being deployed as practical infrastructure (not as therapy)
- An ethical distinction the tradition makes that clarifies the news event
- A historical or scriptural parallel that recontextualizes what is happening
- A practice being used by a named community in a specific context

### What it does not do

- Validate the news event ("teachers agree this is an important issue")
- Explain the news to the reader from a position of authority
- Quote a teacher in generic inspirational terms
- Imply that spiritual practice will solve the problem

### Integration rules

The teacher layer should be woven into the article, not isolated in a single block. A sentence of news fact followed immediately by its spiritual/ethical counterpart is stronger than a separate "Teacher Perspective" section that addresses the same issue from a distance.

- ✗ "Young people face increasing levels of anxiety. Spiritual teacher Ahjan teaches that anxiety can be worked with through breath practices."
- ✓ "In communities where clinical mental health resources are scarce, some youth workers have begun integrating structured breath practices from contemplative traditions into after-school programs — not as spiritual instruction, but as a repeatable physiological tool."

### No teacher names in news articles

Pearl News does not promote individual teachers by name in news or feature articles. The teacher layer is attributed to the Forum collectively, to a tradition, or to a named community practice. Commentary is the one exception, where a specific teacher's interpretive framework may be named and attributed.

---

## 7. Youth Specificity Standard

The `youth_impact_specificity` quality gate fails any article with vague youth impact. This spec defines what passes.

**Required: at least one anchor from this list:**
- A number (percentage, count, survey result) with a source
- A named geography (country, region, city)
- A named age band (adolescents 12–17, young adults 18–24, Gen Z, Gen Alpha)
- A named cohort (first-generation university students, youth climate activists, out-of-school youth)
- A concrete behavior (not a feeling — what they do, where they go, what they stop doing)

**The contradiction test (from generational research):**
The most powerful youth-impact paragraphs hold a contradiction. Young people who simultaneously fear economic precarity and spend significantly on experience. Climate anxiety that drives both paralysis and disproportionate activism. This is the generational psychology layer made visible in the article. Use it.

**Generic sentences that always fail:**
- "Young people are increasingly affected by..."
- "Youth around the world are struggling with..."
- "The next generation faces unprecedented challenges..."
- "Leaders emphasized the importance of youth voices..."

Each of these can be made to pass by adding a number, a region, a name, or a behavior. The sentence is not discarded — it is made specific.

---

## 8. SDG Integration

SDG references must be accurate, woven in, and not used as a conclusion device.

**Accurate:**
- SDG numbers are fixed. Cross-check against `pearl_news/config/sdg_news_topic_mapping.yaml`.
- UN body names must be exact. "UNICEF" not "the UN children's agency" in first reference.
- No implied endorsement. The SDG framework is a reference lens, not a partnership.

**Woven in:**
The SDG frame should appear where it illuminates — in the body of the article, connected to a specific fact — not only at the end as a citation.

- ✗ "This event relates to SDG 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions."
- ✓ "Progress on SDG 16 — specifically its targets on reducing violence against children — has stalled in the regions most affected by this conflict. The UN's 2024 progress report identified institutional trust as the sharpest predictor of youth civic engagement in affected zones."

**Not a conclusion device:**
The SDG reference does not close the article. The forward look closes the article. The SDG is a frame used throughout, not a stamp applied at the end.

---

## 9. The Forward Look

The forward look is the last substantive section before the source citation. It is the most commonly written badly. It tends toward generic hope or vague calls to action.

**What the forward look does:**
It names something specific that is coming — a decision, a report, a summit, a deadline, a program that is being tracked — that gives the reader a concrete next point of reference.

**Rules:**
- Name a specific institution, initiative, or decision point
- Give a timeframe when available
- Do not editorialize about outcomes
- Do not end with a value statement

- ✗ "As the world continues to grapple with these challenges, spiritual traditions offer hope for a better future."
- ✗ "Only by working together can we hope to achieve the vision of the SDGs."
- ✓ "The UN Secretary-General's Summit on the Future, scheduled for September 2026, will include a dedicated youth track — the first time the formal agenda has embedded youth delegates with voting-adjacent roles."

## 10. Quality Gates (Writing Layer)

These are the five hard-fail gates enforced in `pearl_news/pipeline/quality_gates.py`. This section explains what they mean for writing, not just what triggers them.

| Gate | Writing implication |
|---|---|
| **Fact check completeness** | Every factual claim in news summary and youth impact needs a traceable source. "Reportedly" is not a source. Paraphrase requires attribution. |
| **Youth impact specificity** | See §7. No vague impact sentences. At least one anchor (number, geography, age band, behavior). |
| **SDG/UN accuracy** | SDG numbers must match the topic mapping. UN body names must be exact. No phrases from the blocklist in `legal_boundary.yaml`. |
| **Promotional tone** | Any sentence that reads as endorsement of a teacher, practice, or organization fails. The test: would this sentence appear in a promotional email for the Forum? If yes, cut it. |
| **UN endorsement** | No phrase implying Pearl News is a UN affiliate, partner, or approved outlet. Check `legal_boundary.yaml` blocklist before publishing. |

---

## 11. What We Never Write

- Generic youth impact ("young people are affected," "the next generation will face")
- Teacher quotes that validate the news event without adding a distinct frame
- SDG references that are not accurate and specific
- Any sentence implying UN affiliation or endorsement
- Devotional or promotional language for any teacher or organization
- Rhetorical questions
- "Historic," "landmark," "unprecedented," "visionary" without substantiation
- "We" — Pearl News does not share experience with its readers; it reports to them
- Hope as a conclusion — the forward look names a fact, not a feeling

---

## 12. Expansion Prompt Guidance

When `pearl_news/pipeline/llm_expand.py` calls the expansion prompt, the model receives `expansion_system.txt`. That prompt governs how a draft article is expanded to target word count.

**The expansion prompt must reference this spec.** Specifically:

- When expanding the **lede**: do not make it more general; make it more specific. Add a number, a location, or a behavior that was implied but not stated.
- When expanding the **youth impact** section: the specificity standard applies (§7). Expanding vague impact into more vague impact fails. Find a data point or a concrete behavior.
- When expanding the **teacher perspective**: do not add devotional language. Add context, a named practice being deployed in a specific setting, or a historical parallel.
- When expanding the **forward look**: find the specific institution, decision point, or deadline. Do not add sentiment.
- **Never invent facts, numbers, quotes, or events.** Elaboration must be contextual and inferential, not fabricated.
- Preserve HTML structure exactly. Expand paragraph text only. Do not add sections or remove the Source line.

The current expansion prompt (`pearl_news/prompts/expansion_system.txt`) should be updated to reference the specificity standard, the teacher integration rules, and the forward look standard from this spec.
