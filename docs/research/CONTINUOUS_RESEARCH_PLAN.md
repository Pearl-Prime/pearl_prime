# Continuous research plan (local Qwen3, no Gemini)

**Purpose:** How the Pearl News continuous research “plane” runs: versioned prompts, feed ingest, local Qwen3 two-pass flow, youth signal sources, and artifact storage. **No Gemini; no external APIs for inference.**

**Generational research spec:** [continue_gen_research3.md](continue_gen_research3.md) is the single buildable spec for the generational intelligence engine (three core layers, two-pass YAML fix, Contradiction Audit, Persona Switching, youth sources).

---

## 1. Runtime and scope

- **Model:** Local **Qwen3-14B-GGUF** only (llama.cpp or Ollama). No Gemini. No cloud inference APIs.
- **Continuity:** Versioned prompts in the repo + optional scheduled **feed-ingest-only** workflow + local runs (or self-hosted runner with Ollama) that write to `artifacts/research/`. Repo history = research ledger.

---

## 2. Two-pass flow (YAML fix)

Qwen3 thinking mode can break valid YAML output. The pipeline uses two passes:

1. **Pass 1 (reasoning):** Run with `/think`. Full analysis (vibration points, invisible scripts, editorial hooks). Save to `artifacts/research/<layer>/<timestamp>_reasoning.md`.
2. **Pass 2 (YAML):** Run with `/no_think`, lower temp. Input: “Using only the following analysis, output a single valid YAML…” Paste Pass 1 summary. Save to `artifacts/research/<layer>/<timestamp>.yaml` with provenance header.

**Script:** [scripts/research/run_research.py](../scripts/research/run_research.py) implements both passes. See [scripts/research/README.md](../scripts/research/README.md).

**Prompt IDs (layers):** `psychology`, `pain_points`, `event_impact` (dims 1–3); `narrative`, `platform`, `linguistic` (dims 4–6). `semantic_trend` uses the semantic trend spotter system prompt and also writes under `artifacts/research/linguistic/`. Each dim 4–6 run concatenates its numbered task files (e.g. `dim4_prompt_4_1` … `_3`) for pass 1, then one YAML instruction file for pass 2.

## 3. Youth signal sources

Real youth conversation lives on TikTok, Reddit, YouTube, Discord, Instagram—not only RSS. The pipeline:

- **RSS:** UNICEF, UN Youth, Pew, Teen Vogue Politics, etc. Listed in [config/research/youth_feed_sources.yaml](../config/research/youth_feed_sources.yaml). Fetched to `artifacts/research/raw/` or `youth_feed_snapshots/` by [.github/workflows/research_feeds_ingest.yml](../.github/workflows/research_feeds_ingest.yml) (weekly) or manually.
- **Platforms:** Manual paste of trend/comment snippets or link lists into paste-and-extract prompts. Documented in [RESEARCH_FEED_SOURCES.md](RESEARCH_FEED_SOURCES.md).

## 5. How to run continuously

- **Option A:** GitHub Action runs [research_feeds_ingest.yml](../.github/workflows/research_feeds_ingest.yml) on a schedule (e.g. weekly). You run Qwen3 locally (e.g. weekly): `run_research.py --prompt-id psychology --paste artifacts/research/raw/<date>/unicef_news.xml` (or paste preprocessed text). Commit new artifacts.
- **Option B:** Local cron runs `fetch_feeds.py` and/or `run_research.py`; you commit artifacts.
- **Option C:** Self-hosted GitHub runner with Ollama runs `run_research.py` on schedule and commits artifacts.

All options keep inference local (Qwen3 only); no Gemini.

### 5.1 `run_research.py` examples (all layers)

Validate wiring without calling Ollama (checks prompt files exist and prints paths):

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python3 scripts/research/run_research.py --prompt-id psychology --dry-run
PYTHONPATH=. python3 scripts/research/run_research.py --prompt-id narrative --dry-run
PYTHONPATH=. python3 scripts/research/run_research.py --prompt-id platform --dry-run
PYTHONPATH=. python3 scripts/research/run_research.py --prompt-id linguistic --dry-run
PYTHONPATH=. python3 scripts/research/run_research.py --prompt-id semantic_trend --dry-run
```

Full two-pass run (requires Ollama), same raw paste for every sub-task in that layer:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python3 scripts/research/run_research.py --prompt-id narrative --paste path/to/raw.txt
PYTHONPATH=. python3 scripts/research/run_research.py --prompt-id platform --paste path/to/raw.txt
PYTHONPATH=. python3 scripts/research/run_research.py --prompt-id linguistic --paste path/to/raw.txt
PYTHONPATH=. python3 scripts/research/run_research.py --prompt-id semantic_trend --paste path/to/raw.txt
```

Outputs: `artifacts/research/<layer>/<timestamp>_reasoning.md` and `<timestamp>.yaml` (with provenance header), except `semantic_trend` shares the **linguistic** artifact directory.

## Feed Capture Status

Feed captures begin accumulating on next scheduled `fetch_feeds.py` run.
