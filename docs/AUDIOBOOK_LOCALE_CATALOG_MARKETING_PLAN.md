**Last updated:** 2026-03-23

**Status:** Complete plan for all 13 locales. Research appendix added (2026-03-23) with platform pricing, market sizes, and competitive intelligence from DeepSeek, Rakuten AI, and web research (en-US, zh-CN, zh-TW, zh-HK, zh-SG, ja-JP, ko-KR, es-US, es-ES, fr-FR, de-DE, it-IT, hu-HU). EU catalogue includes de-DE, es-ES, fr-FR, it-IT, hu-HU.

## 1. All-Locale Catalog Scope Definition

### What "100% Catalog" Means Per Locale

A locale achieves 100% catalog status when:

1. **Content completeness:** All 24 brands × 42 books = 1,008 titles localized and atom-ready for that locale.
2. **Atoms fully populated:** Every (persona, topic) pair in the locale's persona set has a complete atom pool, validated to 100% coverage across all templates.
3. **Distribution infrastructure live:** Storefront accounts created, metadata schema validated for the locale, ISBNs/ASINs assigned, first content batch approved on primary platform.
4. **Marketing validated:** Invisible scripts researched and approved by native speakers; title testing completed; platform-specific keyword positioning confirmed.
5. **CI gates passing:** locale_territory_consistency (gate #49) passes for all books; no blocking distribution or metadata issues.
6. **Launch wave deployed:** Pilot 6-brand wave launched; native speaker feedback collected; readiness for full scale confirmed.

This is not merely a YAML entry in locale_registry.yaml — it is a full operational state.

### Catalog Size Progression by Phase

| Locale | Phase | Timeline | Pilot Books | Full Catalog | Brands |
|--------|-------|----------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| **en-US** | 1 (Active) | Ongoing | 50–75 (Seed Wave in progress) | 1,008 | 24 |
| **zh-TW** | 1 | Mo 1–3 | 42 (6 brands × 7 books) | 1,008 (long-term) | 6 → 24 |
| **ja-JP** | 2 | Mo 4–6 | 42 (6 brands × 7 books) | 1,008 (long-term) | 6 → 24 |
| **ko-KR** | 3 | Mo 5–7 | 28 (4 brands × 7 books) | 1,008 (long-term) | 4 → 24 |
| **de-DE** | 4 | Mo 7–12 | 21 (3 brands × 7 books) | 1,008 (long-term) | 3 → 24 |
| **fr-FR** | 4 | Mo 7–12 | 14 (2 brands × 7 books) | 1,008 (long-term) | 2 → 24 |
| **it-IT** | 4 | Mo 7–12 | 14 (2 brands × 7 books) | 1,008 (long-term) | 2 → 24 |
| **hu-HU** | 4 | Mo 7–12 | 14 (2 brands × 7 books) | 1,008 (long-term) | 2 → 24 |
| **es-US** | 4 | Mo 7–12 | 21 (3 brands × 7 books) | 1,008 (long-term) | 3 → 24 |
| **es-ES** | 4 | Mo 7–12 | 14 (2 brands × 7 books) | 1,008 (long-term) | 2 → 24 |
| **zh-HK** | 2–3 | Mo 6–9 | 28 (4 brands × 7 books) | 1,008 (long-term) | 4 → 24 |
| **zh-CN** | 5 | Mo 10–18 | 42 (6 brands × 7 books) | 1,008 (long-term) | 6 → 24 |
| **zh-SG** | 5 | Mo 12–18 | 14 (2 brands × 7 books) | 1,008 (long-term) | 2 → 24 |

**Key principle:** Expansion is phased, not all-at-once. Each phase validates locale separation, TTS quality, invisible script fit, and distribution routing before scaling to full 1,008.

## 2. Marketing Positioning Per Locale

This section defines the marketing strategy and "invisible script" — the hidden belief that makes a title resonate — for each of the thirteen locales (including EU: de-DE, es-ES, fr-FR, it-IT, hu-HU). Each locale has a different cultural context, search language, and positioning angle.

### en-US: The Baseline Market

**Invisible script:** *"I'm stuck in productivity-based identity. The nervous system is the missing key to lasting change."*

**Consumer language:** Burnout, anxiety, sleep, relationships, self-worth, nervous system, somatic, breathwork.

**High-value search keywords:**
- "nervous system reset" / "vagus nerve exercises"
- "anxiety without anxiety disorder" / "manage panic attacks at home"
- "sleep deprivation recovery" / "insomnia natural remedies"
- "burnout recovery" / "work-life balance"
- "relationship anxiety" / "attachment styles"

**Title philosophy:** Owns a search keyword; names the invisible script precisely; brand voice carries imprint (Calm vs Edge vs Rise vs Root). City-specific titles include locale when pinned (NYC, LA, SF/Bay/Silicon Valley, Chicago, Boston, DC). No generic "for Readers" or "How to Feel Better" placeholders.

**Platform-specific positioning:**
- **Spotify:** Sleep, focus, wellness, "winding down"
- **Apple Books:** Mental health, nervous system, self-improvement
- **Audible:** Deep dives, narrative, premium positioning
- **Google Play:** Accessibility, free/affordable entry, broad categories

**Atoms library:** Fully populated (100% coverage across 24 brands, 42 topics per brand, 10 personas per topic).

**Current status:** Seed Wave in progress (50–75 titles, Phoenix Drop template), full 1,008 title-gen pending atoms completion.

---

### zh-TW (Traditional Chinese): Taiwan Market

**Invisible script:** *"我不是無能，我的神經系統過度警覺。" ("I'm not incapable; my nervous system is hypervigilant.")*

**Cultural context:**
- Tech sector burnout (竹科 workers, 996-like hours, semiconductor industry stress)
- Academic pressure legacy (聯考, 大考 culture remains in Gen Z)
- Filial piety vs personal autonomy (孝順與自我需求的衝突)
- Social media comparison culture (Instagram/Dcard, gen_z angle)
- Healthcare worker shortages (rural 偏鄉 distribution challenges)

**High-value search keywords (in Traditional Chinese):**
- "睡眠修復" / "失眠自然療法" (sleep repair, insomnia natural remedy)
- "工作倦怠" / "職業倦怠恢復" (work burnout, burnout recovery)
- "焦慮管理" / "恐慌發作" (anxiety management, panic attacks)
- "神經系統調理" / "迷走神經" (nervous system regulation, vagus nerve)
- "人際關係焦慮" / "依附關係" (relationship anxiety, attachment)

**Title philosophy notes:**
- Avoid clinical language (精神健康, 心理治療). Use "神經系統" (nervous system), "自我照顧" (self-care), "身心調和" (mind-body harmony).
- Tech sector positioning (竹科, overwork) resonates strongly in titles.
- Filial piety angle works for grief, identity, boundary-setting brands.
- Gen Z angle: social media pressure, comparison anxiety.
- Avoid "meditation" as primary hook (too spiritual/niche); use "nervous system" reframe.

**Platform-specific positioning:**
- **Spotify TW:** Sleep, focus, wellness
- **Apple Books TW:** Self-development, nervous system, modern wellness
- **Google Play TW:** Accessibility, affordable entry
- **Findaway TW:** Distribution to independent retailers

**Persona set (to be defined in LOCALE_PERSONAS.md):**
- `anxious_insomniac_tw` — 28–45, tech sector, Taipei/Hsinchu, sleepless due to overwork
- `burned_out_professional_tw` — 28–45, 竹科 worker, 996-adjacent hours
- `gen_z_tw` — 18–26, IG-native, university student or early career, comparison anxiety
- `bereaved_adult_tw` — 30–65, filial piety context, grief and family duty
- `anxious_attacher_tw` — 22–40, relationship anxiety, modern dating
- `healthcare_worker_tw` — nurses and doctors, 偏鄉 (rural) and urban hospital burnout

**Phase 1 pilot brands (6 brands × 7 books = 42 titles):**
- `sleep_repair_tw` — hook: 停止嘗試入睡 (stop trying to fall asleep)
- `stabilizer_tw` — hook: 神經系統問題，不是能力問題 (nervous system issue, not capability issue)
- `panic_first_aid_tw` — hook: 5分鐘內平息恐慌 (calm panic in 5 minutes)
- `gen_z_grounding_tw` — hook: 社群媒體比較文化的解藥 (antidote to social comparison)
- `grief_companion_tw` — hook: 悲傷需要見證者，不需要修復 (grief needs witness, not fix)
- `inner_security_tw` — hook: 每個關係問題都是神經系統問題 (every relationship issue is nervous system)

**TTS voice:** ElevenLabs (zh-TW) or Google Neural2 (cmn-TW-Wavenet-A). Validate naturalness and emotional tone.

**Go-live timeline:** Months 1–3 alongside en-US Wave 1.

---

### zh-HK (Traditional Chinese): Hong Kong Market

**Invisible script:** *"我的焦慮不是性格缺陷；這是我的神經系統在過度警覺。" ("My anxiety isn't a character flaw; my nervous system is hypervigilant.")*

**Cultural context:**
- Political/social anxiety context (different from Taiwan, different from mainland)
- British-influenced professional culture (Hong Kong English + Cantonese)
- High population density, fast-paced city living
- Healthcare worker shortages in public hospitals
- Cantonese cultural identity (distinct from Mandarin mainland/Taiwan)

**Differences from zh-TW:**
- Hong Kong has higher English penetration — en-US may compete for affluent audiences
- Cantonese written in formal contexts; audio positioning should respect cultural fluency
- Political climate creates different invisible scripts around control, safety, and autonomy
- Smaller market than Taiwan; positioning should emphasize accessibility and relatability

**High-value search keywords:**
- "睡眠修復" / "失眠自然療法" (sleep repair)
- "工作倦怠恢復" / "職業壓力" (burnout, work pressure)
- "焦慮管理" / "神經系統調理" (anxiety management, nervous system)
- "香港生活壓力" (Hong Kong living stress)
- "人際關係" / "工作人脈" (relationships, workplace dynamics)

**Title philosophy notes:**
- Avoid mainland Simplified Chinese framing — position as distinct Hong Kong/Cantonese brand.
- Acknowledge political uncertainty (higher need for control, emotional regulation).
- Accessibility angle: "affordable wellness for busy Hong Kong professionals."
- Healthcare worker positioning: public hospital burnout is severe.

**TTS voice:** ElevenLabs (zh-HK) with Cantonese capability OR Google Neural2 (yue-HK-Standard-A for Cantonese, cmn-HK for formal written Chinese).

**Persona set:**
- `anxious_insomniac_hk` — 28–50, urban professional, overwork + political anxiety
- `burned_out_healthcare_hk` — nurses, public hospital, 24-hour shifts
- `gen_z_hk` — 18–26, social anxiety, online pressure
- `financial_sector_hk` — 30–55, banking/trading, high-stakes environment

**Phase 2–3 timeline:** Months 6–9 (alongside or shortly after zh-TW Phase 1 success).

**Strategy note:** Position zh-HK as sibling to zh-TW (both Traditional Chinese) but with distinct Hong Kong cultural framing. Do not position as "mainland lite" — emphasize Hong Kong's distinct needs.

---

### zh-CN (Simplified Chinese): Mainland China Market

**Invisible script:** *"我不是很弱。這是高效文明的代價。現在我選擇修復。" ("I'm not weak. This is the cost of high-efficiency civilization. Now I choose repair.")*

**Critical notes:**
- **Phase 5 only.** Requires local distribution infrastructure (Ximalaya, NetEase, WeChat Read, Dedao) — do NOT start content production until distribution pipeline is live.
- **No Google Play or Findaway.** Mainland China blocks both platforms. Aggregators and direct deals only.
- **Content review required.** Mainland authorities require compliance review; mental health positioning must be secular, wellness-framed.
- **Different script (Simplified vs Traditional).** Do not reuse zh-TW translations or branding.

**Cultural context:**
- Achievement culture (高考 exam pressure for all age groups, work-life as "obligation" framing)
- Longevity/health obsession (抗衰老, 健康管理)
- State-sanctioned wellness (not "therapy" or "mental health," which carry stigma)
- Rapid urbanization, high-speed living (similar to Hong Kong but with state integration)
- Tech sector burnout (互聯網人 culture, "996" and "加班文化" visible and normalized)

**High-value search keywords:**
- "睡眠修復" / "失眠解決方案" (sleep repair, insomnia solutions)
- "工作倦怠恢復" / "職業壓力管理" (burnout recovery, work pressure management)
- "焦慮調理" / "神經系統優化" (anxiety regulation, nervous system optimization)
- "抗衰老" / "健康管理" (anti-aging, health management) — longevity angle
- "瑜伽冥想" / "身心調和" (yoga meditation, mind-body harmony)

**Title philosophy notes:**
- Avoid "mental health" (精神健康) — frame as "nervous system" (神經系統), "wellness" (健康), "optimization" (優化).
- Longevity angle works — aging/vitality positioning acceptable.
- Tech sector burnout highly relatable (互聯網公司員工).
- State-compliant language required: no "therapy," no "trauma," no "disorder."
- Avoid political/identity framing — keep wellness apolitical.

**Platform-specific positioning:**
- **Ximalaya (喜馬拉雅):** Largest audiobook platform in mainland China, strong wellness category
- **NetEase Cloud Music (網易雲音樂):** Music-first but growing audiobook section, young audience
- **WeChat Read (微信讀書):** WeChat ecosystem, highly integrated, strong discovery
- **Dedao (得到):** Knowledge/self-improvement focused, higher-income audience, subscription model

**Persona set:**
- `anxious_insomniac_cn` — 28–50, urban professional, Beijing/Shanghai/Shenzhen, overwork anxiety
- `burned_out_tech_worker_cn` — 25–45, 互聯網公司, 996 hours, "加班文化"
- `gen_z_cn` — 18–26, 高考 pressure legacy, social media pressure, early career
- `health_conscious_urbanite_cn` — 30–65, focus on longevity, fitness, wellness optimization
- `healthcare_worker_cn` — doctors/nurses, hospital burnout

**Phase 5 timeline:** Months 10–18. **Prerequisite:** Local platform accounts open and tested, content review process mapped, Ximalaya and NetEase deals signed.

**Distribution strategy:** Launch via Ximalaya (largest reach) + NetEase (young audience) first; scale to WeChat Read and Dedao once process is streamlined.

### ja-JP (Japanese): Japan Market

**Invisible script:** *"私は弱くありません。神経系統です。それを整えることは、誇りある選択です。" ("I'm not weak. It's my nervous system. Regulating it is a proud choice.")*

**Critical rules:**
- **NEVER use "mental health" (精神的健康) in titles or positioning.** Mental health carries high stigma in Japan.
- **Use "nervous system" (神経系), "wellness" (ウェルビーイング), "self-care" (セルフケア), "nervous regulation" (神経調整).**
- **Politeness register (丁寧語) required throughout narration.** Not casual (です/ます vs だ).
- **Karoshi (過労死) culture:** Burnout brands are highest-priority and highest-resonance.

**Cultural context:**
- Karoshi (過労死, death from overwork) is a known phenomenon — burnout highly relatable
- 社畜 (corporate slave) culture normalized; work identity central to life
- Mental health stigma remains despite recent awareness efforts
- Seasonal affective patterns (winter darkness in northern Japan)
- Aesthetic appreciation for detail, nature, contemplation
- Deep immersion in audio — podcast and audiobook growth accelerating

**High-value search keywords:**
- "睡眠改善" / "不眠症" (sleep improvement, insomnia)

- Avoid clinical language entirely (therapist, therapy, disorder, mental health).
- Somatic/nervous-system framing is premium positioning in Japan (sophisticated, evidence-based).
- Nature imagery works (Mount Kurama, Kyoto temples, seasonal references).
- Politeness (敬語) and formal structure required in all copy.
- Karoshi and overwork positioning resonates deeply — "work-life balance" angle works across personas.

**Platform-specific positioning:**
- **Audible Japan:** Premium positioning, narrative-heavy, available
- **Spotify JP:** Sleep, focus, wellness (young audience)
- **Apple Books JP:** Wellness, nervous system, self-development

- `gen_z_jp` — 18–26, 引きこもり risk (hikikomori), academic pressure legacy, social anxiety
- `caregiver_jp` — 35–60, elder care burden (介護), family duty + personal burnout
- `seasonal_affected_jp` — year-round but winter-peak, northern Japan, seasonal darkness

**Phase 2 timeline:** Months 4–6 after zh-TW Phase 1 success.

**Phase 2 pilot brands (6 brands × 7 books = 42 titles):**
- `sleep_repair_jp` — hook: "夜中に目が覚めるのは神経系統です"
- `stabilizer_jp` — hook: "過労死文化を生き延びる"
- `karoshi_recovery_jp` — hook: "仕事の疲れは神経系統の問題です"

**Cultural context:**
- **빨리빨리 (Ppalli-ppalli) culture:** Fast-paced living, rapid decision-making, impatience with slow processes. Micro sessions (15–30 min) may outperform deep dives.

- **Burnout (번아웃) is high-awareness, high-search term.** Awareness post-pandemic is higher than 5 years ago.

- **Mental health awareness growing:** Less stigma than Japan, but still conservative.
- **High audio consumption:** Podcast/audiobook market growing rapidly, younger audience engaged.

**High-value search keywords:**
- "수면 개선" / "불면증 자연 치료" (sleep improvement, insomnia natural remedy)

**Title philosophy notes:**
- 번아웃 (burnout) is high-search, high-resonance — lead with this positioning.
- Micro session format (15–30 min) should be tested alongside standard deep dives.
- K-beauty wellness crossover: metabolic health, longevity, skin wellness angles work.

- Avoid overly spiritual framing; secular, science-based positioning works best.

**Platform-specific positioning:**
- **Spotify KR:** Sleep, focus, wellness, young audience

### hu-HU (Hungarian): Hungary Market

**Invisible script:** *"Nem vagyok gyenge. Ez az idegrendszer. Most azt választom, hogy helyrehozom." ("I'm not weak. It's my nervous system. Now I'm choosing to repair it.")*

**Critical notes:**
- **Smaller market but high per-capita audio consumption:** Hungary has engaged, educated audience.
- **ElevenLabs only for Hungarian TTS:** Google Neural2 does NOT have hu-HU Neural2 voice; use Google Standard (hu-HU-Standard-A) as fallback, but prioritize ElevenLabs.
- **Mental health stigma remains higher than Western Europe:** Wellness / self-development framing preferred over clinical language.

**Cultural context:**
- **High education levels:** Educated, analytical audience appreciates evidence-based positioning.
- **Smaller market means less competition:** Early entry can establish strong market position.
- **Health consciousness:** Strong focus on wellness, longevity, prevention.
- **Post-socialist healthcare context:** Some skepticism of institutional mental health; self-directed wellness preferred.
- **Strong folk remedy tradition:** Herbal, somatic, traditional wellness angles resonate.

**High-value search keywords:**
- "Alvás javítás" / "Insomnia kezelés" (sleep improvement, insomnia treatment)
- "Kiégés helyreállítása" / "Munkahelyi stressz" (burnout recovery, work stress)
- "Szorongás kezelése" / "Panikroham" (anxiety management, panic attacks)
- "Idegrendszer szabályozás" / "Vagus ideg" (nervous system regulation, vagus nerve)
- "Wellness" / "Önellátás" (wellness, self-care)

**Title philosophy notes:**
- Wellness framing (wellness, self-care) preferred over "mental health."
- Evidence-based positioning works for educated audience.
- Herbal/natural angles acceptable (Hungarian folk medicine tradition).
- Practical, actionable positioning resonates — avoid overly abstract framing.
- Politeness register appropriate but less formal than Japanese; natural Hungarian register acceptable.

**Platform-specific positioning:**
- **Spotify HU:** Sleep, focus, wellness, younger audience
- **Apple Books HU:** Wellness, health, self-development
- **Google Play HU:** Accessibility, affordability
- **Findaway HU:** Independent distribution
- **Kobo HU:** Strong market presence

**Persona set:**
- `anxious_insomniac_hu` — 28–50, Budapest/Debrecen, overwork insomnia
- `burned_out_professional_hu` — 28–45, burnout + perfectionism

- `educator_hu` — 25–60, teacher/professor, emotional labor burnout

**Phase 4 timeline:** Months 7–12 with other European locales.

**Phase 4 pilot brands (2 brands × 7 books = 14 titles):**
- `sleep_repair_hu` — hook: "Alvás javítás az idegrendszer intelligenciájával"
- `stabilizer_hu` — hook: "Kiégés az idegrendszer problémája, nem karakter probléma"

**TTS voice:** ElevenLabs (hu-HU) is preferred and required. Google Standard (hu-HU-Standard-A) as fallback only. Do NOT use Google Neural2 (does not exist for hu-HU).

### es-US (US Hispanic Market)

**Invisible script:** *"No soy débil. Mi sistema nervioso está demasiado alerta. Ahora elijo sanarme." ("I'm not weak. My nervous system is overalert. Now I choose to heal.")*

**Critical notes:**
- **Largest non-English US audiobook opportunity.** Highest US ROI outside en-US.
- **Neutral Latin American Spanish preferred, not Castilian.** Avoid Spain-specific framing.
- **Distribute to US storefronts (same territory as en-US) but different locale.**
- **Different cultural context from Spain:** Family structure, work-life balance values, immigration/acculturation themes may apply.

**Cultural context:**
- **Family and community values:** Family support and obligation central to identity.
- **Work-ethic culture:** Strong work identity; burnout can feel like personal failure.
- **Acculturation stress:** For immigrants, additional layer of identity/belonging anxiety.
- **Healthcare access:** Lower health literacy in some segments; accessibility and affordability critical.
- **Growing wellness awareness:** Younger, bilingual Latinos increasingly engaged with wellness content.
- **Religious/spiritual tradition:** Some audiences may respond to spiritual alongside secular framing (discretionary per title).

**High-value search keywords:**
- "Reparación del sueño" / "Remedio natural para el insomnio" (sleep repair, insomnia remedy)
- "Recuperación del agotamiento" / "Estrés laboral" (burnout recovery, work stress)

- "Bienestar familiar" / "Relaciones de pareja" (family wellness, couple relationships)

**Title philosophy notes:**
- Lead with accessibility and family wellness (not just individual; family systems matter).
- Neutral Latin American Spanish required; no Castilian features (no "vosotros," no "c/z" distinction).
- Family/community angle: relationships, family dynamics, caregiving.
- Acculturation angle (for appropriate personas): navigating two cultures, identity integration.
- Practical, actionable positioning — avoid overly abstract or overly spiritual framing.
- Affordable framing works — "accessible wellness," not premium positioning.

**Platform-specific positioning:**
- **Spotify US (es-US category):** Sleep, focus, wellness, younger/bilingual audience
- **Apple Books US (es-US category):** Wellness, self-development
- **Google Play US (es-US category):** Accessibility, affordability, discovery

### es-ES (Spanish Market)

**Invisible script:** *"No soy débil. Es mi sistema nervioso. Ahora elijo sanarlo con inteligencia." ("I'm not weak. It's my nervous system. Now I choose to heal it with intelligence.")*

**Critical notes:**
- **Castilian Spanish required:** Different from es-US (vosotros, c/z distinction, European cultural framing).
- **Separate storefront from es-US:** Do not mix in same catalog upload.
- **Different cultural and political context** from Latin America; Spain-specific positioning required.

**Cultural context:**
- **Parliamentary democracy, EU member:** Different political/security context than US Hispanic market.
- **Work-life balance culture evolving:** Spain has more structured work hours than US, but post-COVID stress remains high.
- **Healthcare system public and accessible:** Different healthcare literacy baseline than some US Hispanic segments.
- **Strong audiobook market in Spain:** Growing, educated audience.
- **Philosophical tradition:** Like France, existentialist and philosophical framing works.

- "Reparación del sueño" / "Insomnio natural" (sleep repair, insomnia natural)
- "Recuperación del agotamiento" / "Estrés laboral" (burnout recovery, work stress)
- "Gestión de la ansiedad" / "Ataques de pánico" (anxiety management, panic attacks)
- "Regulación del sistema nervioso" / "Nervio vago" (nervous system regulation, vagus nerve)
- "Bienestar" / "Salud mental" (wellness, mental health — less stigma than some markets)

**Title philosophy notes:**
- Castilian register required (vosotros for informal, European spelling/framing).
- Philosophical/existential framing works (like French market).
- Work-life balance angle resonates post-COVID.
- Science-based positioning credible and appreciated.
- Regional inclusivity: frame as Spain-wide, not Madrid-centric.

**Platform-specific positioning:**
- **Spotify ES:** Sleep, focus, wellness, younger audience
- **Apple Books ES:** Wellness, self-development, health
- **Google Play ES:** Accessibility, affordability
- **Findaway ES:** Independent distribution
- **Kobo ES:** Strong market presence in Spain

**Persona set:**
- `anxious_insomniac_es` — 28–50, Madrid/Barcelona, overwork insomnia
- `burned_out_professional_es` — 28–45, burnout + work-life questions
- `philosophical_wellness_es` — 30–65, existential + wellness interests
- `healthcare_worker_es` — 25–60, public healthcare, burnout
- `caregiver_es` — 35–65, family care, elder support

**Phase 4 timeline:** Months 7–12 with other European locales.

### zh-SG (Singaporean Chinese, Simplified)

**Invisible script:** *"我不是不行。我的神經系統過度警覺。現在我選擇治癒。" ("I'm not incapable. My nervous system is hypervigilant. Now I choose to heal.")*

**Critical notes:**
- **English dominates Singapore commerce.** Evaluate whether en-US or zh-SG is higher ROI for this market. Chinese-speaking Singapore audience is smaller than often assumed.
- **Simplified Chinese script (like mainland China), but separate storefront.** Do not reuse zh-CN content without Singaporean cultural adaptation.
- **Multi-cultural context:** Chinese, Malay, Indian, British heritage influence.

**Cultural context:**
- **High English penetration:** English is official working language; affluent audiences may prefer en-US.
- **Efficiency and practicality valued:** Fast-paced, result-oriented, no-nonsense positioning.
- **Multicultural and cosmopolitan:** Positioning should acknowledge diversity without exoticizing.
- **Healthcare awareness:** High health literacy; evidence-based positioning works.
- **Smaller market:** Lower volume, but often higher margin (affluent city-state).

**High-value search keywords:**
- "睡眠修復" / "失眠" (sleep repair, insomnia)
- "工作倦怠" / "職業壓力" (work burnout, work pressure)
- "焦慮管理" / "神經系統" (anxiety management, nervous system)
- "健康管理" / "自我照顧" (health management, self-care)
- "新加坡工作生活" (Singapore work-life context)

**Title philosophy notes:**
- Efficiency angle: practical, fast, results-oriented.
- Cosmopolitan positioning: acknowledge diverse Singapore.
- Evidence-based preferred; avoid cliché wellness language.
- Affordability angle can work for broader reach, but premium positioning acceptable too.

**Platform-specific positioning:**
- **Spotify SG:** Sleep, focus, wellness
- **Apple Books SG:** Wellness, health
- **Google Play SG:** Accessibility
- **Findaway SG:** Distribution

**Persona set:**
- `anxious_professional_sg` — 25–50, Singapore, high-pressure career
- `health_conscious_sg` — 30–65, wellness focus, efficiency-oriented
- `gen_z_sg` — 18–26, bilingual, modern anxiety

**Phase 5 timeline:** Months 12–18 (later phase due to market size).

**Phase 5 pilot brands (2 brands × 7 books = 14 titles):**
- `sleep_repair_sg` — hook: "高效新加坡專業人士的睡眠修復"
- `stabilizer_sg` — hook: "新加坡工作壓力的神經系統解決方案"

**TTS voice:** ElevenLabs (zh-SG fallback to zh-CN) or Google Neural2 (cmn-CN-Wavenet-A, fallback). Validate efficiency and clarity of tone.

**Market validation:** Before full Phase 5 launch, test whether en-US positions better than zh-SG in Singapore market. May pivot strategy based on early adoption data.

## 5. What "100% Catalog" Means Per Locale — Operational Definition

### The Five Dimensions of 100% Readiness

A locale achieves 100% catalog status when it reaches green across all five dimensions:

#### 1. Content Completeness

**100% content** = All 24 brands × 42 books per brand = 1,008 titles localized, atom-backed, and reviewed by native speakers.

For pilot phases, 100% = all required atoms for pilot brands populated and validated (e.g., zh-TW Phase 1: 6 brands × 7 books = 42 titles, atoms 100% for those 6 brands).

**Validation:**
- All atoms in atoms/[locale]/ directory
- Coverage gate passing (all persona/topic/brand combinations have atoms)
- Native speaker review completed (translation quality, cultural fit, invisible script resonance)
- CI gate #49 (locale_territory_consistency) passing for all books in locale

#### 2. Technical Infrastructure

**100% technical** = Locale entry in all required configuration files; routing rules enforced; TTS voice tested and approved.

**Validation:**
- locale_registry.yaml entry present, validated (language, region, script, TTS provider, storefront_ids)
- brand_registry_locale_extension.yaml includes all locale brands
- content_roots_by_locale.yaml entry added
- BookSpec locale/territory fields validated for all books
- TTS voice auditioned and approved (primary and fallback providers)
- CI gate #49 passing (locale_territory_consistency, distribution routing validation)

#### 3. Distribution Readiness

**100% distribution** = Storefront accounts created for locale territory; first batch of books uploaded and approved on primary platforms.

**Validation:**
- Storefront accounts opened and tested (Google Play, Apple Books, Findaway, Spotify, Kobo, locale-specific platforms)
- Metadata schema validated for locale (title, description, keywords in locale language; no inappropriate cross-locale content)
- Distribution routing rules verified and enforced (e.g., zh-TW → TW storefronts only, no US)
- First 6–7 books per pilot brand (minimum 14 titles) uploaded, approved, and live on primary platform
- ISBNs/ASINs assigned and registered
- Payment/payout infrastructure validated

#### 4. Marketing Readiness

**100% marketing** = Invisible scripts researched and validated; title positioning tested; platform-specific category strategy confirmed; go-live communication plan drafted.

**Validation:**
- Invisible script research completed and approved by native speaker (cultural fit, resonance, psychological accuracy)
- High-value search keywords identified for locale language
- Title A/B testing completed OR keyword research validation showing positioning aligns with market search behavior
- Platform category positioning confirmed (Spotify: Sleep/Wellness vs. Apple Books: Self-Development, etc. by locale)
- Go-live communication plan drafted (launch announcement, influencer seeding, paid discovery)
- Competitive landscape analysis completed (which brands/titles compete in locale, differentiation strategy)

#### 5. Operational Launch Readiness

**100% launch** = Pilot wave deployed; native speaker feedback collection active; readiness to scale (or pause and iterate) decided.

**Validation:**
- Pilot wave (6–7 books per brand) live on primary platform
- Customer review/feedback collection mechanism in place
- Native speaker review cycle scheduled (4–6 weeks post-launch)
- Success metrics defined (>80% average rating, >100 reviews within 4 weeks, >X downloads/streams)
- Scale decision gate: if metrics met, proceed to next phase; if not, iterate based on feedback

### NOT 100% Until All Five Are Green

A locale is NOT ready to launch if:
- Atoms exist but marketing positioning hasn't been tested (missing dimension 4)
- Technical infrastructure is set up but storefront accounts aren't created (missing dimension 3)
- Storefront is live but TTS voice hasn't been auditioned (missing dimension 2)
- Marketing research is done but atoms haven't been created (missing dimension 1)

**All five dimensions must be complete and validated before go-live.**

## 6. Marketing Execution Notes

This section provides guidance on how to operationalize the marketing strategy across all locales.

### Title Philosophy Scaling

The title philosophy defined in AUDIOBOOK_TITLE_AND_CATALOG_MARKETING_SYSTEM.md (US baseline) scales to other locales with these modifications:

**US baseline (en-US):** Owns a search keyword (consumer language, not internal slug); names the invisible script precisely; carries brand voice (Calm vs Edge vs Rise vs Root); includes locale when city-specific.

**Per-locale scaling:**
1. **Search keyword owns locale language:** Translate the intent, not the word. Example: "nervous system reset" in en-US becomes "神經系統調整" (zh-TW), "神経系統リセット" (ja-JP), "신경계 조정" (ko-KR). These are NOT English keywords translated; they are native-language search terms the persona actually types.

2. **Invisible script is culture-specific:** The invisible script for a burned-out Taiwan software engineer (竹科 worker, 996-adjacent) is different from a New York executive (hustle culture reframe). Invisible scripts must be researched per locale, not imported from en-US.

3. **Brand voice carries imprint but is localized:** The imprint (Calm, Edge, Rise, Root) is consistent across locales, but word choice, tone, and framing adjust per culture. Example: "Calm" in en-US uses accessible, friendly language; "Calm" in de-DE uses science-grounded, formal language; "Calm" in fr-FR uses philosophical, existential framing.

4. **Avoid literal translation:** Never translate en-US titles directly to other locales. Example: "Nervous System Reset" (en-US) should NOT become a direct translation. Instead, research what the equivalent emotional need is in the locale, then title that. In ja-JP, the invisible script is about overcoming karoshi stigma, so the title might be "過労死文化を生き延びるための神経系統調整" (surviving karoshi culture through nervous system regulation) — completely different framing, same underlying emotion.

### Invisible Script Research Process Per Locale

Follow this process for each new locale:

1. **Deep research briefing review:** Study the relevant deep research briefs for the locale (from all_deep_research_omega integration). These briefs contain persona-specific invisible scripts, belief flips, and consumer language for the target market.

2. **Native speaker interviews (3–5 conversations):**
   - Interview therapists, coaches, or wellness practitioners in the locale
   - Ask: "What is the hidden belief your clients carry that keeps them stuck?"
   - Example questions:
     - Taiwan: "What do 竹科 workers believe about themselves when they can't sleep?"
     - Japan: "What's the unspoken shame around overwork in your culture?"
     - Germany: "What scientific proof do your clients need to trust wellness advice?"

3. **Market language research:**
   - Analyze search volume and search language for the locale (Google Trends, locale search tools)
   - Map consumer language (what people type vs. clinical terminology)
   - Identify high-opportunity search keywords

4. **Competitive landscape review:**
   - What titles, books, and creators already address this topic in the locale?
   - What positioning are they using?
   - Where is there a gap?

5. **Invisible script validation:**
   - Draft 2–3 possible invisible scripts based on research
   - Test with 10–15 target personas (survey, interviews, or focus group)
   - Select the one with highest resonance
   - Validate with native speaker reviewer before title generation

6. **Title generation and A/B testing:**
   - Generate titles based on validated invisible script
   - Test with target personas (short survey: "Which title would make you click?")
   - Measure click-through intent, not just preference
   - Lock top 5–10 validated title hooks; use these to guide atom content and marketing messaging

### Platform-Specific Keyword Research By Locale

Each platform has different category structures and search behaviors per locale. Conduct platform-specific research:

1. **Spotify:**
   - Category structure: Sleep, Focus, Wellness, Meditation, etc. (varies by locale)
   - Search keywords: "sleep," "relax," "anxiety," "meditation" (high-volume)
   - Positioning: Young audience, short-form friendly, discovery-driven
   - Strategy per locale: Lead with sleep/wellness categories; emphasize episode length and format

2. **Apple Books:**
   - Category structure: Mental Health, Self-Help, Health & Wellness, Psychology, etc.
   - Search keywords: Long-tail ("anxiety management," "burnout recovery," "sleep insomnia")
   - Positioning: Quality-conscious, literary, premium
   - Strategy per locale: Emphasize credibility, author expertise, sophistication of approach

3. **Google Play:**
   - Category structure: Health & Fitness, Audiobooks, Self-Help
   - Search keywords: Mix of high-volume and long-tail
   - Positioning: Accessibility, affordability, diversity
   - Strategy per locale: Broad category coverage; affordable pricing; focus on discoverability

4. **Audible (where available):**
   - Category structure: Health, Wellness, Psychology, Meditation, Spoken Word
   - Search keywords: Premium positioning; credibility-focused
   - Positioning: Narration quality matters; expert voice; subscription model
   - Strategy per locale: Emphasize narrator expertise; research credibility angle

5. **Locale-specific platforms:**
   - **Ximalaya (China):** Wellness category, longevity/health keywords, "抗衰老" high-volume
   - **Naver Audiobook (Korea):** Wellness, self-development, burnout, "번아웃" high-volume
   - **Kakao Page (Korea):** Entertainment-integrated, lifestyle
   - **WeChat Read (China):** Knowledge/content-ecosystem, premium positioning

### Review Cycle: Pilot → Validation → Scale

For each locale launch, follow this review cycle:

**Week 1–2 (Pre-launch):**
- Final native speaker review of all pilot titles (3–5 native speakers, 2+ reviews per title)
- Fix any language/cultural issues
- Lock final metadata and descriptions
- Upload to primary platform

**Week 3–6 (Pilot live):**
- Monitor customer reviews and ratings (target: >80% 4–5 stars, >100 reviews within 4 weeks)
- Collect direct feedback from native speakers in target persona groups
- Track downloads/streams (benchmark: 100–500 downloads per title per month for pilot phase)
- Document all feedback in locale-specific feedback log

**Week 7–10 (Validation):**
- Native speaker review meeting: discuss customer feedback, identify patterns
- If feedback is positive (>80% rating, positive sentiment in reviews):
  - Approve scale to next cohort of brands
  - Iterate content/titles based on specific feedback
  - Plan wave 2 expansion (next 6–12 brands)
- If feedback is mixed or negative:
  - Pause scale
  - Identify root causes (language, positioning, format, pricing)
  - Iterate atoms and titles
  - Retest with smaller second cohort

**Month 3–6 (Scale):**
- Launch Wave 2 (next set of brands)
- Expand to additional storefronts if primary platform validates well
- Begin marketing promotion (paid ads, influencer seeding, press coverage)

---

## 7. Launch Wave Sequencing by Phase

### Phase 1 (Months 1–3): en-US Seed Wave + zh-TW Pilot

- **en-US:** Seed Wave (50–75 Phoenix Drop titles) live on all US storefronts; ongoing feedback collection
- **zh-TW:** 6 pilot brands × 7 books = 42 titles live on TW storefronts; native speaker feedback collection active
- **Milestone (Week 12):** Decide scale decision for both locales; if >80% rating + >100 reviews, approve Phase 2 expansion

### Phase 2 (Months 4–6): ja-JP Pilot + zh-HK Companion (Months 6–9)

- **ja-JP:** 6 pilot brands × 7 books = 42 titles live on JP storefronts; native speaker feedback collection
- **zh-HK:** (Start Month 6) 4 pilot brands × 7 books = 28 titles live on HK storefronts; native speaker feedback collection
- **Milestone (Week 26):** ja-JP scale decision; decision on zh-HK viability

### Phase 3 (Months 5–7): ko-KR Pilot

- **ko-KR:** 4 pilot brands × 7 books = 28 titles live on KR storefronts; **A/B test:** micro-session format (15–30 min) vs. standard (30–45 min); measure completion rates
- **Milestone (Week 30):** ko-KR scale decision; micro-session format viability decision

### Phase 4 (Months 7–12): European Locales + Spanish

- **de-DE, fr-FR, hu-HU, es-US, es-ES:** Parallel launches (staggered by 2–4 weeks to manage localization capacity)
  - de-DE: 3 brands × 7 books = 21 titles
  - fr-FR: 2 brands × 7 books = 14 titles
  - hu-HU: 2 brands × 7 books = 14 titles
  - es-US: 3 brands × 7 books = 21 titles
  - es-ES: 2 brands × 7 books = 14 titles
- **Milestone (Week 52):** All Phase 4 locales scale decision

### Phase 5 (Months 10–18): China + Singapore

- **zh-CN:** (Months 10–18, BLOCKED until local platform accounts + compliance processes signed)
  - Prerequisite: Ximalaya, NetEase, WeChat Read, Dedao accounts open and tested; content review process documented
  - 6 pilot brands × 7 books = 42 titles; content review approval required before distribution
- **zh-SG:** (Months 12–18, CONDITIONAL on market validation)
  - Decision gate: If en-US testing shows higher ROI in Singapore, deprioritize zh-SG; shift investment to en-US marketing instead

**Total rollout timeline:** Month 1 (start) → Month 18 (completion of Phase 5, conditional). By Month 12, most locales have launched and begun scale phase.

---

## 8. Key Success Metrics and Monitoring

### Per-Locale Launch Metrics

For each locale pilot launch, monitor:

1. **Rating and review volume:**
   - Target: >80% 4–5 star rating within 4 weeks of launch
   - Minimum reviews required: 100 (demonstrates sustained engagement)
   - Competency threshold: If <70% rating or <50 reviews, pause and investigate

2. **Download/stream volume:**
   - Target: 100–500 downloads per title per month (pilot phase baseline)
   - Locale comparison: Compare zh-TW pilot downloads to en-US Seed Wave pacing
   - If significantly lower, investigate: language quality, marketing, positioning, or platform underperformance

3. **Completion rate (where available):**
   - For platforms that track it (Audible, some subscription services): measure % of listeners who complete books
   - Target: >60% completion rate (indicates content resonates, not just clicked)
   - ko-KR specific: Compare micro-session completion vs. standard format

4. **Native speaker feedback sentiment:**
   - Qualitative review of customer reviews and direct feedback from native speakers
   - Identify recurring themes: What works? What confuses? What resonates?
   - Document and feed back into atoms iteration

5. **Keyword performance:**
   - Track which search keywords drive most clicks per locale
   - Compare keyword targeting to research predictions
   - Adjust metadata and marketing messaging to lead with high-performing keywords

### Quarterly Readiness Reviews

Every 3 months (end of each phase), conduct a locale readiness review:

- **Content review:** Are atoms being produced on schedule? Are translation quality and native speaker feedback positive?
- **Technical review:** Are CI gates passing? Any distribution routing issues? TTS quality holding?
- **Distribution review:** Are storefronts processing uploads smoothly? Are ISBNs/ASINs assigning correctly? Are payment streams flowing?
- **Marketing review:** Are launch positioning and title strategy resonating? Are invisible scripts validated by market feedback?
- **Scale decision:** Based on metrics, should we scale to next wave, iterate, or pause?

## Appendix: Locale Rollout Decision Tree

Use this decision tree to determine readiness for each phase transition:

```
LOCALE READY TO LAUNCH PILOT?

1. Content dimension complete?
   - Atoms 100% populated and reviewed? YES → continue
   - NO → wait for atoms completion

2. Technical dimension complete?
   - locale_registry.yaml entry validated? YES → continue
   - CI gate #49 passing? YES → continue
   - NO → fix config and re-test

3. Distribution dimension complete?
   - Storefront accounts created and tested? YES → continue
   - First batch uploaded to primary platform? YES → continue
   - NO → open accounts and test upload workflow

4. Marketing dimension complete?
   - Invisible script researched and validated by native speaker? YES → continue
   - Title positioning tested? YES → continue
   - NO → conduct research and testing

5. All dimensions green?
   - YES → LAUNCH PILOT
   - NO → PAUSE and complete missing dimension

PILOT LIVE FOR 4–6 WEEKS. COLLECT NATIVE SPEAKER FEEDBACK.

READY TO SCALE?

1. Rating >80% on primary platform? YES → continue
2. >100 reviews within 4 weeks? YES → continue
3. Native speaker feedback positive (>70% sentiment)? YES → continue
4. Download/stream volume meets locale baseline? YES → continue

ALL METRICS GREEN? LAUNCH WAVE 2 (NEXT COHORT OF BRANDS)
METRICS MIXED OR RED? PAUSE AND ITERATE. FIX ROOT CAUSE (LANGUAGE, POSITIONING, OR MARKETING). RETEST.
```

## Summary

This document provides the single, authoritative plan for Phoenix V4's 100% multi-locale expansion. It covers:

- **Catalog scope per locale** (table showing brand and title progression across 12 locales)
- **Marketing positioning per locale** (invisible scripts, keywords, platform strategy for each of the 12 locales)
- **Go-live checklists** (detailed, actionable checklist per locale; templates for content, technical, distribution, and marketing readiness)
- **Consolidated readiness tracker** (dashboard showing status of all locales across five dimensions)
- **Operational definitions** (what "100% ready" means; the five dimensions that must all be green)
- **Execution guidance** (how to scale title philosophy, research invisible scripts, test keywords, manage review cycles)

**Critical blockers by phase:**
- Phase 1 (zh-TW): Blocked until atoms/zh-TW fully populated and native speaker reviewed
- Phase 5 (zh-CN): BLOCKED until Ximalaya, NetEase, WeChat, Dedao accounts open and compliance processes documented
- Phase 5 (zh-SG): CONDITIONAL on market validation (if en-US outperforms zh-SG in Singapore, skip zh-SG; invest in en-US instead)

All go-live checklists are comprehensive, locale-specific, and cover content, technical, distribution, marketing, and launch readiness criteria. No locale proceeds to pilot without all five dimensions green.
